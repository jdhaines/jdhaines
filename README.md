## ❓ About Me

Josh Haines is an Enterprise DevSecOps Specialist and Senior Materials Engineer with over a decade of experience solving problems in complex industries. He is a Lilly Scholar who worked for Honeywell Aerospace and Johns Manville before being pulled back to central Indiana to help Rolls-Royce ten years after an internship. In 2020, he transitioned to a full-time role in the Digital Transformation group as a DevSecOps Strategy and Curation Specialist. This completes a gradual pivot from building digital tools in various roles, to starting and running a Software Factory at Rolls-Royce, to a career in “digital and data.”

As a two-time small business owner and recovering serial hobbyist, he loves to learn new skills using freely available information, online classes, and self-paced learning. He incorporates his self-taught abilities as a developer, data scientist, and DevOps enthusiast into projects both professional and charitable.

Josh grew up across the river from Purdue University and enjoys being back in Indiana close to family. He currently lives in Lafayette with his wife Chris and daughters Nora and Jenny. Josh holds a BS and MS from Purdue University in Materials Engineering.
